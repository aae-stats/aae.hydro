### Working with aquatic data in R

`aae.data` is an R package to access and work with data relevant to the AAE group, particularly streamflow data. This is a work in progress. The goal of this work is to provide access to all publicly available data sets used by the AAE group. The current version includes data from the Victorian WMIS and tools to summarise and analyse these data. 

You can install the package directly from GitHub using the remotes package:

``` r
remotes::install_github("aae-stats/aae.data")
```

Please leave feedback, bug reports or feature requests at the GitHub [issues page](https://github.com/aae-stats/aae.data/issues).
