# To-do
- [] list sites efficiently and include site info in downloaded tables, e.g. lat/long, elevation.
- [] search sites by basin/river/partial code and return all sites near a location.
- [x] allow subsetting by season/month in other resolutions, particularly annual.
- [x] decide whether to message or warn for missing data
- [] add historical climate download from BOM records, either with bomrang or a lighter setup within aae.data
- [] check message printed about missing data, seems to print discharge as missing if converted from height
- [] add functions for rescale rather than a list argument; could have defaults such as by_median
- [] shift to-do list to GH issues page
- [] fix warning about data availability; currently prints "no data" and "incomplete data" even if only one is true
